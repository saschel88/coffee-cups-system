## üèóÔ∏è General Rules

### 1.1 Project Structure
- **MUST** follow Clean Architecture principles
- **MUST** use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns
- **MUST** separate concerns into distinct layers:
  - `cmd/` - Application entry points (server, migrate, server-no-bot)
  - `internal/` - Private application code
    - `config/` - Configuration management
    - `database/` - Database connection and setup
    - `handlers/` - HTTP request handlers
    - `logger/` - Logging utilities
    - `models/` - Data models (User, Box, CoffeeLog, Payment)
    - `services/` - Business logic services
    - `server/` - HTTP server setup
    - `telegram/` - Telegram bot implementation
  - `api/` - API specifications (swagger.yaml)
  - `docs/` - Documentation
  - `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
  - `configs/` - Configuration files

### 1.2 Naming Conventions
- **MUST** use descriptive, self-documenting names
- **MUST** use camelCase for Go variables and functions
- **MUST** use PascalCase for Go types and public functions
- **MUST** use snake_case for database fields and API endpoints
- **MUST** use kebab-case for file names and directories

### 1.3 Error Handling
- **MUST** handle all errors explicitly
- **MUST** use structured logging for errors
- **MUST** return meaningful error messages to users
- **MUST NOT** ignore errors with `_`

---

## üíª Code Standards

### 2.1 Go Code Rules
```go
// ‚úÖ GOOD
func (s *UserService) GetUserByID(id uint32) (*models.User, error) {
    if id == 0 {
        return nil, errors.New("invalid user ID")
    }
    // implementation
}

// ‚ùå BAD
func GetUser(id uint32) *models.User {
    // no error handling, no validation
}
```

### 2.2 Code Organization
- **MUST** have one main function per file in `cmd/`
- **MUST** group related functionality in packages
- **MUST** use interfaces for external dependencies
- **MUST** keep functions under 50 lines
- **MUST** keep files under 300 lines

### 2.3 Comments and Documentation
- **MUST** document all public functions
- **MUST** use `//` for single-line comments
- **MUST** use `/* */` for multi-line comments
- **MUST** explain complex business logic

```go
// CreateUser creates a new user in the system
// Returns the created user or an error if creation fails
func (s *UserService) CreateUser(req *CreateUserRequest) (*models.User, error) {
    // implementation
}
```

  - `500` - Internal Server Error
- **MUST** use proper HTTP methods:
  - `GET` - Retrieve data
  - `POST` - Create new resources
  - `PUT` - Update existing resources
  - `DELETE` - Remove resources

### 3.3 Request/Response Format
```json
// ‚úÖ GOOD - Consistent response format
{
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Success",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}

// ‚ùå BAD - Inconsistent format
{
  "user": { ... },
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### 3.4 API Versioning

### 4.2 Migrations
- **MUST** create migration files for schema changes
- **MUST** make migrations reversible

### 4.3 Queries
- **MUST** use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **MUST** use transactions for multi-table operations
- **MUST** avoid N+1 query problems
- **MUST** use appropriate indexes

```go
// ‚úÖ GOOD
db.Where("user_id = ?", userID).Find(&logs)

// ‚ùå BAD
db.Raw(fmt.Sprintf("SELECT * FROM logs WHERE user_id = %d", userID))
```

## üìä Business Layer Description (Product Manager View)

### Core Business Value Proposition
The Coffee Cups System solves the common office problem of fair cost distribution for shared coffee consumption. It eliminates manual tracking, reduces disputes, and ensures everyone pays their fair share based on actual usage.

### Key Business Entities

#### 1. **Users** üë•
- **Purpose**: Track who is consuming coffee
- **Key Data**: Telegram ID, name, activity status
- **Business Rules**: 
  - Users are automatically registered via Telegram
  - Users can be deactivated but not deleted
  - Each user has a unique Telegram ID

#### 2. **Coffee Boxes** üì¶
- **Purpose**: Represent a physical coffee capsule package
- **Key Data**: Name, total cups, price, creator, active status
- **Business Rules**:
  - Only active boxes can be consumed from
  - Box creator is responsible for initial cost
  - Box capacity is fixed and cannot be exceeded

#### 3. **Coffee Logs** ‚òï
- **Purpose**: Track individual coffee consumption
- **Key Data**: User, box, timestamp
- **Business Rules**:
  - Each log represents one cup consumed
  - Cannot log coffee from empty boxes
  - Timestamp is automatically set

#### 4. **Payments** üí∞
- **Purpose**: Track who owes what for coffee consumption
- **Key Data**: User, box, amount, payment status
- **Business Rules**:
  - Payments are calculated based on actual consumption
  - Each user pays their proportional share
  - Payments can be marked as paid

### Business Workflows

#### 1. **Coffee Consumption Workflow**
1. User sends `/coffee <box_id>` to Telegram bot
2. System validates box exists and has remaining cups
3. System logs the consumption
4. System updates payment calculations
5. User receives confirmation with remaining cups

#### 2. **Box Management Workflow**
1. User creates a new box with name, cups, and price
2. System calculates cost per cup
3. System tracks consumption as users log coffee
4. System calculates each user's share based on consumption
5. Users can view their payment obligations

#### 3. **Payment Settlement Workflow**
1. System calculates each user's total owed amount
2. Users can view their payment status
3. Users can mark payments as paid
4. System tracks payment history

### Business Metrics & KPIs

#### 1. **Usage Metrics**
- Total coffee consumed per user
- Average consumption per user per period
- Most popular coffee boxes
- Consumption patterns by time/date

#### 2. **Financial Metrics**
- Total revenue from coffee sales
- Average cost per cup
- Payment collection rates
- Outstanding payment amounts

#### 3. **System Health Metrics**
- Active users count
- Active boxes count
- System uptime
- API response times

### Business Rules & Constraints

#### 1. **Consumption Rules**
- Users cannot consume more cups than available in a box
- Each consumption must be logged with a valid user and box
- Consumption timestamps are immutable

#### 2. **Payment Rules**
- Payment amounts are calculated proportionally based on consumption
- Users only pay for coffee they actually consumed
- Payment status can be updated but not deleted

#### 3. **Data Integrity Rules**
- Users cannot be deleted if they have consumption logs
- Boxes cannot be deleted if they have consumption logs
- All financial calculations must be auditable

### Value Proposition for Different Stakeholders

#### 1. **For Office Managers**
- Eliminates manual coffee cost tracking
- Reduces disputes over shared costs
- Provides clear financial reporting
- Automates fair cost distribution

#### 2. **For Employees**
- Simple Telegram-based interface
- Transparent cost calculation
- Easy payment tracking
- No manual record keeping

#### 3. **For Finance Teams**
- Automated cost allocation
- Detailed consumption reports
- Payment tracking and reconciliation
- Audit trail for all transactions

### Future Business Opportunities

#### 1. **Expansion Features**
- Multi-office support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with expense management systems
- Mobile app for non-Telegram users

#### 2. **Monetization Opportunities**
- Premium features for larger organizations
- Analytics and reporting services
- Integration with corporate systems
- White-label solutions
